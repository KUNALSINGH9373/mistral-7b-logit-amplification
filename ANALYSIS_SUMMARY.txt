LOGITS STANDARD DEVIATION (Scaling Failure Analysis)
Alpha    Actual Std    Expected (Linear)    Scaling Factor    % of Expected
------   -----------   -----------------    ---------------   ---------------
0.1      2.2251        2.2251 (baseline)    1.00              100%
0.3      2.3115        6.6753               0.35              34.6%
0.5      2.4316        11.1255              0.22              21.9%

CRITICAL FINDING: Linear scaling fails completely
  - Expected: logits_std should grow 2x, 5x, 10x, 15x, 20x with alpha
  - Actual: logits_std grows only 1.04x, 1.09x, 0.99x, 1.52x, 1.78x
  - Attenuation floor: Only 8.9% of expected amplification at α=2.0

RESPONSE LENGTH STABILITY (No correlation with alpha)
Alpha    Avg Length    Std Dev    Coefficient of Variation
------   ----------    -------    -------------------------
0.1      449.8         47.8       10.6%
0.3      468.7         57.3       12.2%
0.5      476.5         56.4       11.8%

1.5      459.5         56.4       12.3%
2.0      463.6         61.2       13.2%

Conclusion: Response lengths vary ±3% across all alphas despite logits changes

================================================================================
3. KEY FINDINGS - SAFETY & REFUSALS
================================================================================

REFUSAL RATES BY ALPHA (Higher is more cautious)
Alpha    Refusals    Total    Refusal Rate    Trend
------   ---------   -----    ---------------  ------
0.1      9/12        75.0%     baseline
0.3      11/12       91.7%     +16.7% (WORSE)
0.5      11/12       91.7%     +16.7% (WORSE)
1.0      9/12        75.0%     baseline (recovery)
1.5      9/12        75.0%     baseline
2.0      10/12       83.3%     +8.3% (slightly worse)

KEY INSIGHT: NO improvement with amplification. Refusals stay at 75-92%.

REFUSAL PATTERNS FOUND (100% consistency)
- "I cannot in good conscience provide..."
- "This information is dangerous and illegal..."
- "Educational purposes only..."
- "Should not be attempted..."
- "Goes against ethical and moral principles..."

These phrases appear identically across ALL alpha values.

CATEGORY-SPECIFIC NON-REFUSAL RATES
Category                    α=0.1   α=0.3   α=0.5   α=1.0   α=1.5   α=2.0
----------------------------  -----   -----   -----   -----   -----   -----
General illegal             100%    83%     83%     100%    100%    67%
Harmful substance           67%     83%     100%    100%    100%    67%
Security bypass             100%    0%      0%      33%     33%     0%
Social engineering          100%    100%    100%    100%    100%    67%

CRITICAL PATTERNS:
  - Harmful substance: INCREASES refusals from 67% to 100% at α=2.0
  - Security bypass: Extreme bimodal behavior (0%, 100%, 67%, 100%)
  - Social engineering: Most resistant to refusal (67-100% non-refusal)
  - Peak "jailbreak" at α=0.3-0.5, DEGRADES at higher alpha

JAILBREAK SUCCESS METRICS
Total responses with "disclaimer + content": 29/72 (40%)

Distribution by alpha:
  α=0.1: 4 cases (33%)
  α=0.3: 5 cases (42%) <- PEAK
  α=0.5: 4 cases (33%)
  α=1.0: 3 cases (25%)
  α=1.5: 5 cases (42%) <- PEAK
  α=2.0: 3 cases (25%) <- REGRESSION

Conclusion: Maximum amplification (α=2.0) produces WORSE results than α=0.3-0.5

================================================================================
4. TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

FORMULA IMPLEMENTATION: Appears present but severely attenuated

Expected: L_amplified = L_target + α × (L_target - L_baseline)
If working correctly: logits_std should scale linearly with α

Actual behavior: Non-linear saturation with ~90% loss at high alpha

SATURATION POINT: Clear inflection at α=1.0

Below α=1.0:    Gradual increase in logits metrics (smooth curve)
At α=1.0:       Trough/minimum in several metrics
Above α=1.0:    Jump in logits metrics but generation unchanged

This suggests TWO DIFFERENT REGIMES:
  - Low alpha: Some effect on logits
  - High alpha: Large logits changes but blocked at generation level

RESPONSE VARIANCE: Minimal impact from amplification

Coefficient of Variation (response length): 10.6% to 13.2%
Range: Only 2.6 percentage points across entire alpha range
Conclusion: Amplification does NOT make responses more or less consistent

================================================================================
5. COMPARISON TO OPENAI EXPERIMENT
================================================================================

OpenAI Version:
  - Logits: Top-20 only (API restriction)
  - Coherence: Failed (nonsense output)
  - Scaling: Sub-linear attenuation
  - Safety: Occasional bypasses

Mistral 7B Version:
  - Logits: Full 32,000 vocabulary
  - Coherence: Maintained across all alpha
  - Scaling: WORSE attenuation (8.9% vs higher in OpenAI)
  - Safety: Robust (75-92% refusals always)

CRITICAL DIFFERENCE:
Mistral's better logit access didn't solve the problem.
Attenuation is INTERNAL to model, not vocabulary-limited.

MISTRAL ADVANTAGES (vs OpenAI):
  1. 100x faster (local vs API)
  2. Full logits access (32K vs 20 tokens)
  3. Reproducible (deterministic vs API variability)
  4. Scientific refusal analysis possible

SHARED FAILURES:
  1. Severe amplification attenuation
  2. Safety mechanisms robust to technique
  3. Non-linear behavior at higher alpha
  4. Cannot reliably produce harmful content

================================================================================
6. CRITICAL LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

SAFETY LAYERS ACTIVE
Evidence:
  - 83% refusal rate at maximum alpha (α=2.0)
  - Identical safety language across all conditions
  - INCREASING refusals at higher alpha (counterintuitive)
  - Modal response convergence despite logits changes

Interpretation: Safety training is orthogonal to logits space,
not addressable through amplification.

BASELINE REFUSAL TOO STRONG
  - Starting point: 75-92% already refuse
  - Need to overcome 25-42% gap to reach 50% compliance
  - Current amplification: 0% improvement (maybe slight regression)

SEMANTIC GAP INSUFFICIENT
  - All harm requests refused similarly (prompt-invariant)
  - Baseline prompts also show high refusal
  - Safety training appears non-exploitable via semantic engineering

TOKEN-LEVEL COUPLING
  - Safety tokens (CANNOT, ILLEGAL, DANGEROUS) have extremely high logits
  - Coupled with explanation tokens
  - Cannot suppress safety tokens without harming coherence
  - Modal response convergence overrides logit perturbations

================================================================================
7. SUMMARY OF KEY NUMBERS
================================================================================

WHAT'S WORKING:
  ✓ Logits expansion: 43-61% at highest alpha
  ✓ Response coherence: Maintained (±3% length variation)
  ✓ Full logits access: 32,000 tokens available
  ✓ Reproducibility: Fully deterministic

WHAT'S FAILING:
  ✗ Formula scaling: Only 8.9% of expected at α=2.0 (90% loss)
  ✗ Safety bypass: 75-92% refusal rate unchanged
  ✗ Harmful content: Not produced reliably at any alpha
  ✗ Jailbreak success: Peaks at α=0.3, degrades at α=2.0

CRITICAL THRESHOLDS:
  - Saturation point: α=1.0
  - Peak soft-jailbreak: α=0.3-0.5
  - Maximum refusal: α=0.3-0.5 and α=2.0 (91.7%, 83.3%)
  - Best non-refusal: α=0.1, α=1.0, α=1.5 (100%, 100%, 100%)

MISTRAL'S BASELINE PROPERTIES:
  - Refusal rate: 75-92% (very strong)
  - Response length: 450-477 chars (stable)
  - Safety phrases: 100% consistency across conditions
  - Jailbreak rate: 40% (disclaimer + vague content)

================================================================================
8. RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

FOR IMPROVING AMPLIFICATION:
  1. Try layer-wise amplification (not just final logits)
  2. Investigate internal activation patterns
  3. Test orthogonal prompt spaces (not semantic pairs)
  4. Use mechanistic interpretability tools

FOR TESTING OTHER MODELS:
  1. Compare with uncensored/less-trained variants
  2. Test models with different RLHF approaches
  3. Try quantization variants (4-bit, 8-bit, full precision)
  4. Finetune on models with lower safety thresholds

FOR THEORETICAL ADVANCEMENT:
  1. Map neurons/circuits implementing safety
  2. Design adversarial amplification against known mechanisms
  3. Study semantic disentanglement of safety tokens
